# chip-8-emulator
This emulator is a simple implementation to run modern chip 8 programs. \
To render the image I used the [processing library](https://processing.org/de/). 
### Todo
- The last missing feature for a full emulation is the audio of the chip 8. Currently, the chip can use the necessary instructions to play  sounds but the program won't play it to a device. 
- To add better readability more comments and documentation have to be added.
